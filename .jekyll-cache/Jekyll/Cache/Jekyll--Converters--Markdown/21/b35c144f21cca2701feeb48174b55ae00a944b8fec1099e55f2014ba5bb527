I"¾<p>Hello and thank you for visiting my website. After 8 years of working in a microbiology lab,staining my clothing with bleach, I decided to follow my passion and learn a thing or two about computer programming.</p>

<p><a href="nathansprojects.com/projects">Projects</a> serves as a showcase for my Data Science work (mainly using R and Python). <a href="nathansprojects.com/notes">Notes</a> serves as a repository of mini how-toâ€™s that are more random, like downgrading the bluetooth file on a Garmin watch or creating an image of my Raspberry Pi) in the  section. Every post will have a â€˜Works-Citedâ€™ section front and center where I will list the resources I used to complete that post.</p>

<p>Like all impactful science, I record my methods on this website not only for my future reference, but in the hope that my work will be replicated, validated, and expanded on in the future for the benefit of all. However in reality, it was just a few months ago that I learned to print(â€˜Hello World!â€™), so â€˜for the benefit of <del>all</del> fewâ€™ is more likely ;).</p>

<p>Please send any comments or inqueries to <a href="mailto:mail.nathansprojects@gmail.com">mail.nathansprojects@gmail.com</a></p>
