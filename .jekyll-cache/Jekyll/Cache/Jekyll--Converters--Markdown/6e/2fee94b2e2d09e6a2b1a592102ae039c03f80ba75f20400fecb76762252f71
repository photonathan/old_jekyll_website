<p>I never thought my love of Studio Ghibli films would improve my experience working from home. I first learned of Rajio Taiso (Radio Calisthenics) from watching the 2013 documentary ‘The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness.’ The documentary gives viewers a behind the scenes look into the Japanese offices of Studio Ghibli as they work on the films ‘The Wind Rises’ and ‘The Tale of the Princess Kaguya’. 
Rajio Taiso means radio calisthenics.</p>
