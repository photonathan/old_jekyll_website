<p>I never thought my love of Studio Ghibli films would improve my experience working from home. I first learned of Rajio Taiso (Radio Calisthenics) from watching the 2013 documentary â€˜The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness.â€™ The documentary gives viewers a behind the scenes look into the Japanese offices of Studio Ghibli as they work on the films â€˜The Wind Risesâ€™ and â€˜The Tale of the Princess Kaguyaâ€™. 
Rajio Taiso means radio calisthenics.</p>
