I"ê<p>My name is Nathan Goldberg, and thank you for visiting my website. After 8 years of working in a Biosafety cabinet, staining my clothing with bleach, I decided to follow my passion and learn a thing or two about computer programming. This website serves as a showcase for my Data Science work (mainly using R and Python) in the <a href="nathansprojects.com/projects">Projects</a> section as well as a repository of mini how-toâ€™s (random guides like how to downgrade the Bluetooth software on my Garmin watch or create an image of my Raspberry Pi) in the <a href="nathansprojects.com/notes">Notes</a> section.</p>

<p>Every post will have a â€˜Works-Citedâ€™ section front and center where I will list the resources I used to complete that post. Like all impactful science, I record my methods on this website not only for my future reference, but in the hope that my work will be replicated, validated, and expanded on in the future for the benefit of all. However in reality, it was just a few months ago that I learned to print(â€˜Hello World!â€™), so â€˜for the benefit of <del>all</del> fewâ€™ is more likely ;).</p>
