Backing up photos while traveling
(or the many uses of an iPhone USB adapter)

Note: use these external devices with power going to the adapter. If your external device needs addional power, you can plug in a powered usb hub into the usb port of the camera adapter then plug your devices into that. You don't want to run your device with not enough power.

I used to bring an OTG adapter with me to backup my Sony a6400 to my tablet. When the camera was plugged into the tablet with an OTG cable, I was easily able to backup the files to the tablet's interal HD or external microsd card. In my downtime I used my tablet to look at the photos I took and even was able to share some of them when I had wifi.ook on  
Did i connect directly or did i have to use some dumb sony app that was slow?
Looking at my iphone, I noticed that I was barely using half of the interal storage, so i got thinking, is there a way to backup my photos/videos while traveling directly to my iphone?
First time I plugged in SD card adapter, ipohne gave a 'your device requires more power' error. So I plugged in the lighting power and it started fine.

Hooking up my keyboard to the iphone.
	I tried hooking up my NI KK Mk2 to the iphone and it was a little scary. I had the lighting adapter plugged in with power. Then i plugged in the keyboard, pressed the keyboard's power button and turned on for 1/2 a second then shut off, turned on again and started worknig. I opened garage band and I was able to play the keyboard perfectly. I finished my  3 minute test and tried to power cycle the keyboard to see if it wouldn't have the probelm where it turns off at start. It turned on and off about three times before I just pulled the plug.  Then I tried it with a powered usb hub...
